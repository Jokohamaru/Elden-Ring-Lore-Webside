                    <h2>Prologue</h2>
                    <p> Long ago, in The Lands Between, Queen Marika became a vessel for the Elden Ring. And so, in the name of the Erdtree, Marika conquered the Lands with the aid of her husband Godfrey — a mighty warrior and first Elden Lord — who fought alongside his warriors in the name of the Queen until his very last worthy enemy was defeated and Marika's reign was absolute.<br><br>

                        Marika removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring and commanded her loyal shadow, Maliketh, to seal it away. Thus, she and everyone blessed by her Grace would live forever, granting her the title of Queen Marika the Eternal. However, this very same Grace was taken away from Godfrey and his army, whom she instructed to wage war and die abroad, with the promise that life and Grace would be returned to them when needed.<br><br>
                        
                        All those who were stripped of their Grace, as well as their descendants, became known as the Tarnished. True to Marika's promise, their Grace was returned to them after their deaths, and they were called back to the Lands Between to repair the shattered Elden Ring.<br><br>
                        
                        Will the new Tarnished heed the call, or perish and be forgotten?</p>

                    <h3>Transcrip:</h3>
                    <p><em>
                            It happened an age ago. But when I recall, I see it true. On a night of wint'ry fog. The rune of death was stolen And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden. Queen Marika was driven to the brink. The Shattering ensued; a war that wrought only darkness. The Elden Ring was broken, but by whom? And why? What could the Demigods ever hope to win by warring?<br><br>

                            The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn. And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed. These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat. But there would be no victor. And so, we inhabit a fractured world. Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord.<br><br>

                            Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown?</em></p>
